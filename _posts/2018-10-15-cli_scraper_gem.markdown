I just submitted my CLI scraper gem using Fodor's website:

12 Global Food Festivals Worth the Trip. After recently taking an intro to UX design course locally with GirlDevelopIt! I decided that this project should be less about what I want the world to know, speaking as a former scientist and educator, and more about what people will use and what the average person is interested in. So thinking like a developer, what do people obsess over more than anything - food! Instagram is full of pictures of food, as well as facebook and snapchat. The only thing that people seem to agree on anymore, or not get tired of talking about, is the basic necessity of eating food. So, with that in mind, I found a website that would combine travel and food. 

I wanted to keep this project as simple as possible, so I started with a notes .md file that allowed me to envision the basic structure of the program and return to as needed. Then, I studied the structure of several CLI's available on the web as well as the numerous vidoes and tutorials on learn.co. I began filling out the required bin files and my environment file in the library. Shortly after, I realized that I needed to brush up on github commands as well as the process of pushing files to github. My text editor froze quite a bit in this process, so I started 'commiting' my files and pushing them after every single change. During this process, I confirmed with a friend that the website I was using to scrape from was a good choice. She was pleased that there wasn't a lot of Javascript on the site (which we haven't learned yet) and that the html code was formatted in a relatively good structure to scrape from. 

Once I figured out the general structure of my program, how I wanted it to "look" to the user, and gems required, I moved onto building out each method and testing that it worked. I started off using Modules between my CLI and Festival scraper/builder file to share methods between classes. Later in the process, when I encountered a series of errors that broke my program entirely, I decided to use the 'require-all' gem which led to a series of unrelated changes that ended up fixing my program and streamlining it in the process. Eventually my CLI and Festival files worked as intended and I let my project sit. I needed a break, but wanted to continue moving forward, so I began working in SQL. Every day, I would go back to my CLI project with 'fresh eyes' make a few more changes (formatting, formatting, formatting), and then 'move forward' with SQL. Today, I woked up pretty satisfied with my project and began the submission process. 

My plan going forward, is to return to this project through the program, add test code, further clean up formatting, and see if I can't make the program repository as concise as possible. I definitely need to work on formatting.
